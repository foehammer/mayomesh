# What device should I get?

There are so many different devices out right now. For a full list of supported devices, [click here](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/)!

Here are some nodes which we have personal experience with, but do your own research and pick which ever one suits your needs best.

## Fixed Nodes

The [Heltec v3](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/) is small and simple and you can be up and running in a matter of minutes. Supporting both bluetooth connections and WiFi, this node can be a perfect introduction point for a static node. The only downside is that this node uses an ESP chipset so if you're going to want to power it from solar or a battery, then it'll be quite power hungry.

The [RAK WisBlock starter kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit?index=6) is a great node for lower power consumption that also has the versatility of supporting battery, solar and USB-C power input. Supporting a wide variety of sensors and add-ons this is a great platform for those who wish to build something and experiment.

## Portable Nodes

When on the move, there are some more rugged nodes that may suit. 

With an IP65 rating, the [Seeed Studio T1000E](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html) is a great device for attaching to a belt or backpack. With GPS built in, the battery should last you about 2 days (depending on usage).

A similar shape, but by RAK, the [WisMesh Tag](https://hexaspot.com/collections/rakwireless-wisblock-meshtastic/products/wismesh-tag) does a similar job.

For something that might need a better antenna, the [Muzi Works H2T](https://muzi.works/products/h2t-complete-device-heltec-t114-with-gps-running-meshtastic) which uses a Heltec T114 module is popular.
